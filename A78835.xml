            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>IS Majesties thoughts being alwayes sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent to the Peace of His Kingdomes, was and will be ever desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to take all wayes which might the most cleerly make appeare the candour of His intentions to His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113942:3"/>And to this end could find no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way then to propose a Personall free debate with His two Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon all the present differences. Yet finding very much against His expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that this offer was laid aside, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty bent all His thoughts to make His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions fully knowne by a particular An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Propositions delivered to Him in the name of both Kingdomes, 24. <hi>Iuly</hi> last. But the more He endeavoured it, He more plainly saw that any Answer He could make would be subject to mis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations and mis-constructions, which upon His owne Paraphrases and Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions He is most confident will give so good satisfaction, as would doubtlesse cause a happy and lasting Peace. Lest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that good intentions may produce ill effects, His Majesty againe proposeth, and desires againe to come to LONDON, or any of His Houses thereabouts, upon the Publike Faith and Security of His two Houses of Parliament, and the Scotch Commissioners, that He shall be there with Honour, Freedome and Safety:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113942:3"/>Where, by His Personall Presence, He may not onely raise a mutuall confidence betwixt Him and His People, but also have those doubts cleared, and those dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties explained to Him, without which Hee cannot (but with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said mischievous inconveniences) give a particular Answer to the Propositions: And with which He doubts not but so to manifest His reall intentions for the setling of Religion, the just priviledges of Parliament, with the Freedome and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Subject, that it shall not be in the power of wicked and malicious men to hinder the establishing of that firme Peace which all honest men desire. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring them that as He will make no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Demands but such as He beleeves confidently to be just, and much condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the Tranquility of the People: So He will be most willing to condescend to them in whatsoever shall be really for their good and happinesse. Not doubting likewise but you will also have a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to maintaine the just Power of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113942:4"/>Crowne, according to your many Protestations and Professions. For certainly except King and People have reciprocall care each of other, neither can be happy.</p>
            <p>To conclude, 'tis your KING who desires to be heard, (the which if refused to a Subject by a King, he would be thought a Tyrant for it) and for that end which all men professe to desire. VVherefore His Majesty conjures you, as you desire to shew your selves really what you professe, even as you are good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and Subjects, that you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this His Offer, which He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident God will so blesse, that it will be the readyest meanes by which these Kingdomes may again become
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113942:4"/>a comfort to their Friends, and a terrour to their Enemies.</p>
